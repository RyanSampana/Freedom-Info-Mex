We built MongoDB\\nfrom our own experiences building large-scale, high\\navailability, robust systems. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t start from scratch, we\\nreally tried to figure out what was broken, and tackle that.\\nSo the way I think about MongoDB is that if you take\\nMySQL, and change the data model from relational to\\ndocument-based, you get a lot of great features:\\nembedded docs for speed, manageability, agile\\ndevelopment with dynamic schemas, easier horizontal\\nscalability because joins aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as important. There are a lot\\nof things that work great in relational databases: indexes,\\ndynamic queries and updates to name a few, and we\\nhaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed much there. For example, the way you\\ndesign your indexes in MongoDB should be exactly the\\nway you do it in MySQL or Oracle, you just have the option\\nof indexing an embedded field.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Eliot Horowitz, MongoDB CTO and Co-Founder\\nMongoDB is designed for how we build and run\\ndata-driven applications with modern development\\ntechniques, programming models, computing resources,\\nand operational automation.\\n\\nHow We Build & Run Modern\\nApplications\\nRelational databases have a long-standing position in most\\norganizations, and for good reason. Relational databases\\nunderpin existing applications that meet current business\\nneeds; they are supported by an extensive ecosystem of\\ntools; and there is a large pool of labor qualified to\\nimplement and maintain these systems.\\nBut organizations are increasingly considering alternatives\\nto legacy relational infrastructure, driven by challenges\\npresented in building modern applications:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Developers are working with applications that create\\nmassive volumes of new, rapidly changing data types \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nstructured, semi-structured, unstructured and\\npolymorphic data.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Long gone is the twelve-to-eighteen month waterfall\\ndevelopment cycle. Now small teams work in agile\\nsprints, iterating quickly and pushing code every week\\nor two, some even multiple times every day.\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Applications that once served a finite audience are now\\ndelivered as services that must be always-on, accessible\\nfrom many different devices on any channel, and scaled\\nglobally to millions of users.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Organizations are now turning to scale-out architectures\\nusing open source software, commodity servers and\\ncloud computing instead of large monolithic servers and\\nstorage infrastructure.\\n\\nThe Nexus Architecture\\nMongoDB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s design philosophy is focused on combining the\\ncritical capabilities of relational databases with the\\ninnovations of NoSQL technologies. Our vision is to\\nleverage the work that Oracle and others have done over\\nthe last 40 years to make relational databases what they\\nare today. Rather than discard decades of proven database\\nmaturity, MongoDB is picking up where they left off by\\ncombining key relational database capabilities with the\\nwork that Internet pioneers have done to address the\\nrequirements of modern applications.\\n\\nFigur\\nFigure\\ne 1: MongoDB Nexus Architecture, blending the best\\nof relational and NoSQL technologies\\nRelational databases have reliably served applications for\\nmany years, and offer features that remain critical today as\\ndevelopers build the next generation of applications:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Expr\\nExpressive\\nessive query language & secondary Indexes\\nIndexes.\\nUsers should be able to access and manipulate their\\ndata in sophisticated ways to support both operational\\nand analytical applications. Indexes play a critical role in\\nproviding efficient access to data, supported natively by\\nthe database rather than maintained in application code.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Str\\nStrong\\nong consistency\\nconsistency.. Applications should be able to\\nimmediately read what has been written to the\\ndatabase. It is much more complex to build applications\\naround an eventually consistent model, imposing\\nsignificant work on the developer, even for the most\\nsophisticated engineering teams.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Enterprise Management and Integrations.\\nDatabases are just one piece of application\\ninfrastructure, and need to fit seamlessly into the\\nenterprise IT stack. Organizations need a database that\\ncan be secured, monitored, automated, and integrated\\nwith their existing technology infrastructure, processes,\\nand staff, including operations teams, DBAs, and data\\nengineers.\\nHowever, modern applications impose requirements not\\naddressed by relational databases, and this has driven the\\ndevelopment of NoSQL databases which offer:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Flexible Dat\\nData\\na Model. NoSQL databases emerged to\\naddress the requirements for the data we see\\ndominating modern applications. Whether document,\\ngraph, key-value, or wide-column, all of them offer a\\nflexible data model, making it easy to store and combine\\ndata of any structure and allow dynamic modification of\\nthe schema without downtime or performance impact.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Sc\\nScalability\\nalability and P\\nPerformance.\\nerformance. NoSQL databases were\\nall built with a focus on scalability, so they all include\\nsome form of sharding or partitioning. This allows the\\ndatabase to be scaled out across commodity hardware\\ndeployed on-premises or in the cloud, enabling almost\\nunlimited growth with higher throughput and lower\\nlatency than relational databases.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 AlwaysAlways-On\\nOn Global Deployments. NoSQL databases\\nare designed for continuously available systems that\\nprovide a consistent, high quality experience for users\\nall over the world. They are designed to run across many\\nnodes, including replication to automatically synchronize\\ndata across servers, racks, and\\ngeographically-dispersed data centers.\\nWhile offering these innovations, NoSQL systems have\\nsacrificed the critical capabilities that people have come to\\nexpect and rely upon from relational databases. MongoDB\\noffers a different approach. With its Nexus Architecture,\\nMongoDB is the only database that harnesses the\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cFigur\\nFigure\\ne 2: Flexible Storage Architecture, optimising MongoDB for unique application demands\\ninnovations of NoSQL while maintaining the foundation of\\nrelational databases.\\n\\nMongoDB Multimodel\\nArchitecture\\nMongoDB embraces two key trends in modern IT:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Organizations are rapidly expanding the range of\\napplications they deliver to digitally transform the\\nbusiness.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 CIOs are rationalizing their technology portfolios to a\\nstrategic set of vendors they can leverage to more\\nefficiently support their business.\\nWith MongoDB, organizations can address diverse\\napplication needs, hardware resources, and deployment\\ndesigns with a single database technology:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 MongoDB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flexible document data model presents a\\nsuperset of other database models. It allows data be\\nrepresented as simple key-value pairs and flat, table-like\\nstructures, through to rich documents and objects with\\ndeeply nested arrays and sub-documents\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 With an expressive query language, documents can be\\nqueried in many ways \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from simple lookups to creating\\nsophisticated processing pipelines for data analytics\\n\\nand transformations, through to faceted search, JOINs\\nand graph traversals.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 With a flexible storage architecture, application owners\\ncan deploy storage engines optimized for different\\nworkload and operational requirements.\\nMongoDB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s multimodel design significantly reduces\\ndeveloper and operational complexity when compared to\\nrunning multiple distinct database technologies to meet\\ndifferent applications needs. Users can leverage the same\\nMongoDB query language, data model, scaling, security,\\nand operational tooling across different parts of their\\napplication, with each powered by the optimal storage\\nengine.\\n\\nFlexible Storage Architecture\\nMongoDB uniquely allows users to mix and match multiple\\nstorage engines within a single deployment. This flexibility\\nprovides a more simple and reliable approach to meeting\\ndiverse application needs for data. Traditionally, multiple\\ndatabase technologies would need to be managed to meet\\nthese needs, with complex, custom integration code to\\nmove data between the technologies, and to ensure\\nconsistent, secure access. With MongoDB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flexible\\nstorage architecture, the database automatically manages\\nthe movement of data between storage engine\\ntechnologies using native replication.\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cMongoDB 3.4 ships with four supported storage engines,\\nall of which can coexist within a single MongoDB replica\\nset. This makes it easy to evaluate and migrate between\\nthem, and to optimize for specific application requirements\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 for example combining the in-memory engine for ultra\\nlow-latency operations with a disk-based engine for\\npersistence. The supported storage engines include:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The default WiredTiger storage engine. For many\\napplications, WiredTiger\\'s granular concurrency control\\nand native compression will provide the best all round\\nperformance and storage efficiency for the broadest\\nrange of applications.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The Encrypted storage engine protecting highly\\nsensitive data, without the performance or management\\noverhead of separate filesystem encryption. (Requires\\nMongoDB Enterprise Advanced).\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The In-Memory storage engine delivering the extreme\\nperformance coupled with real time analytics for the\\nmost demanding, latency-sensitive applications.\\n(Requires MongoDB Enterprise Advanced).\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The MMAPv1 engine, an improved version of the\\nstorage engine used in pre-3.x MongoDB releases.\\n\\nMongoDB Data Model\\nData As Documents\\nMongoDB stores data in a binary representation called\\nBSON (Binary JSON). The BSON encoding extends the\\npopular JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) representation\\nto include additional types such as int, long, date, floating\\npoint, and decimal128. BSON documents contain one or\\nmore fields, and each field contains a value of a specific\\ndata type, including arrays, binary data and sub-documents.\\n\\nFigur\\nFigure\\ne 3: Example relational data model for a blogging\\napplication\\nDocuments that tend to share a similar structure are\\norganized as collections. It may be helpful to think of\\ncollections as being analogous to a table in a relational\\ndatabase: documents are similar to rows, and fields are\\nsimilar to columns.\\nFor example, consider the data model for a blogging\\napplication. In a relational database the data model would\\ncomprise multiple tables. To simplify the example, assume\\nthere are tables for Categories, Tags, Users, Comments\\nand Articles.\\nIn MongoDB the data could be modeled as two collections,\\none for users, and the other for articles. In each blog\\ndocument there might be multiple comments, multiple tags,\\nand multiple categories, each expressed as an embedded\\narray.\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cDynamic Schema without Compromising\\nData Governance\\nMongoDB documents can vary in structure. For example,\\nall documents that describe users might contain the user id\\nand the last date they logged into the system, but only\\nsome of these documents might contain the user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identity\\nfor one or more third party applications. Fields can vary\\nfrom document to document; there is no need to declare\\nthe structure of documents to the system \\xe2\\x80\\x93 documents are\\nself describing. If a new field needs to be added to a\\ndocument then the field can be created without affecting\\nall other documents in the system, without updating a\\ncentral system catalog, and without taking the system\\noffline.\\nDevelopers can start writing code and persist the objects\\nas they are created. And when developers add more\\nfeatures, MongoDB continues to store the updated objects\\nwithout the need to perform costly ALTER TABLE\\noperations, or worse \\xe2\\x80\\x93 having to re-design the schema\\nfrom scratch.\\nFigur\\nFigure\\ne 4: Data as documents: simpler for developers,\\nfaster for users.\\nAs this example illustrates, MongoDB documents tend to\\nhave all data for a given record in a single document,\\nwhereas in a relational database information for a given\\nrecord is usually spread across many tables. With the\\nMongoDB document model, data is more localized, which\\nsignificantly reduces the need to JOIN separate tables.\\nThe result is dramatically higher performance and\\nscalability across commodity hardware as a single read to\\nthe database can retrieve the entire document containing\\nall related data. Unlike many NoSQL databases, users don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nneed to give up JOINs entirely. For additional flexibility,\\nMongoDB provides the ability to perform left-outer JOINs\\nthat combine data from multiple collections.\\nMongoDB BSON documents are closely aligned to the\\nstructure of objects in the programming language. This\\nmakes it simpler and faster for developers to model how\\ndata in the application will map to data stored in the\\ndatabase.\\n\\nDocument Validation\\nDynamic schemas bring great agility, but it is also important\\nthat controls can be implemented to maintain data quality,\\nespecially if the database is shared by multiple\\napplications. Unlike NoSQL databases that push\\nenforcement of these controls back into application code,\\nMongoDB provides document validation within the\\ndatabase. Users can enforce checks on document\\nstructure, data types, data ranges and the presence of\\nmandatory fields. As a result, DBAs can apply data\\ngovernance standards, while developers maintain the\\nbenefits of a flexible document model.\\n\\nSchema Design\\nAlthough MongoDB provides schema flexibility, schema\\ndesign is still important. Developers and DBAs should\\nconsider a number of topics, including the types of queries\\nthe application will need to perform, relationships between\\ndata, how objects are managed in the application code, and\\nhow documents will change over time. Schema design is an\\nextensive topic that is beyond the scope of this document.\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cFor more information, please see Data Modeling\\nConsiderations.\\n\\nMongoDB Query Model\\n\\nsubscriptions used with your self-managed instances, or\\nhosted MongoDB Atlas instances. MongoDB Compass is\\nfree to use for evaluation and in development\\nenvironments.\\n\\nIdiomatic Drivers\\nMongoDB provides native drivers for all popular\\nprogramming languages and frameworks to make\\ndevelopment natural. Supported drivers include Java,\\nJavascript, .NET, Python, Perl, PHP, Scala and others, in\\naddition to 30+ community-developed drivers. MongoDB\\ndrivers are designed to be idiomatic for the given language.\\nOne fundamental difference with relational databases is\\nthat the MongoDB query model is implemented as\\nmethods or functions within the API of a specific\\nprogramming language, as opposed to a completely\\nseparate language like SQL. This, coupled with the affinity\\nbetween MongoDB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s JSON document model and the data\\nstructures used in object-oriented programming, makes\\nintegration with applications simple. For a complete list of\\ndrivers see the MongoDB Drivers page.\\n\\nInteracting with the Database\\nMongoDB offers developers and administrators a range of\\ntools for interacting with the database, independent of the\\ndrivers.\\nThe mongo shell is a rich, interactive JavaScript shell that is\\nincluded with all MongoDB distributions. Additionally\\nMongoDB Compass is a sophisticated and intuitive GUI for\\nMongoDB. Offering rich schema exploration and\\nmanagement, Compass allows DBAs to modify documents,\\ncreate validation rules, and efficiently optimize query\\nperformance by visualizing explain plans and index usage.\\nSophisticated queries can be built and executed by simply\\nselecting document elements from the user interface, with\\nthe results viewed both graphically, and as a set of JSON\\ndocuments. All of these tasks can be accomplished from a\\npoint and click interface, and all with zero knowledge of\\nMongoDB\\'s query language.\\nMongoDB Compass is included with both MongoDB\\nProfessional and MongoDB Enterprise Advanced\\n\\nFigur\\nFigure\\ne 5: Interactively build and execute database queries\\nwith MongoDB Compass\\n\\nQuerying and Visualizing Data\\nUnlike NoSQL databases, MongoDB is not limited to\\nsimple Key-Value operations. Developers can build rich\\napplications using complex queries, aggregations and\\nsecondary indexes that unlock the value in structured,\\nsemi-structured and unstructured data.\\nA key element of this flexibility is MongoDB\\'s support for\\nmany types of queries. A query may return a document, a\\nsubset of specific fields within the document or complex\\naggregations and transformation of many documents:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Key-value queries return results based on any field in\\nthe document, often the primary key.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Range queries return results based on values defined\\nas inequalities (e.g, greater than, less than or equal to,\\nbetween).\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Geospatial queries return results based on proximity\\ncriteria, intersection and inclusion as specified by a\\npoint, line, circle or polygon.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Sear\\nSearcch queries return results in relevance order and in\\nfaceted groups, based on text arguments using Boolean\\noperators (e.g., AND, OR, NOT), and through bucketing,\\ngrouping and counting of query results. With support for\\ncollations, data comparison and sorting order can be\\ndefined for over 100 different languages and locales.\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Aggr\\nAggregation\\negation F\\nFramework\\nramework queries return aggregations\\nand transformations of values returned by the query\\n(e.g., count, min, max, average, similar to a SQL GROUP\\nBY statement).\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 JOI\\nJOINs\\nNs and graph traversals. Through the $lookup\\nstage of the aggregation pipeline, documents from\\nseparate collections can be combined through a left\\nouter JOIN operation. $graphLookup brings native\\ngraph processing within MongoDB, enabling efficient\\ntraversals across trees, graphs and hierarchical data to\\nuncover patterns and surface previously unidentified\\nconnections.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 MapReduce queries execute complex data processing\\nthat is expressed in JavaScript and executed across\\ndata in the database.\\nAdditionally the MongoDB Connector for Apache Spark\\nexposes Spark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Scala, Java, Python, and R libraries.\\nMongoDB data is materialized as DataFrames and\\nDatasets for analysis through machine learning, graph,\\nstreaming, and SQL APIs.\\n\\nData Visualization with BI Tools\\n\\nMongoDB includes support for many types of secondary\\nindexes that can be declared on any field in the document,\\nincluding fields within arrays:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Unique Indexes\\nIndexes. By specifying an index as unique,\\nMongoDB will reject inserts of new documents or the\\nupdate of a document with an existing value for the field\\nfor which the unique index has been created. By default\\nall indexes are not set as unique. If a compound index is\\nspecified as unique, the combination of values must be\\nunique.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Compound Indexes. It can be useful to create\\ncompound indexes for queries that specify multiple\\npredicates For example, consider an application that\\nstores data about customers. The application may need\\nto find customers based on last name, first name, and\\ncity of residence. With a compound index on last name,\\nfirst name, and city of residence, queries could\\nefficiently locate people with all three of these values\\nspecified. An additional benefit of a compound index is\\nthat any leading field within the index can be used, so\\nfewer indexes on single fields may be necessary: this\\ncompound index would also optimize queries looking for\\ncustomers by last name.\\n\\nWith the MongoDB Connector for BI included in MongoDB\\nEnterprise Advanced, modern application data can be\\neasily analyzed with industry-standard SQL-based BI and\\nanalytics platforms. Business analysts and data scientists\\ncan seamlessly analyze semi and unstructured data\\nmanaged in MongoDB, alongside traditional data in their\\nSQL databases using the same BI tools deployed within\\nmillions of enterprises.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Array Indexes. For fields that contain an array, each\\narray value is stored as a separate index entry. For\\nexample, documents that describe products might\\ninclude a field for components. If there is an index on\\nthe component field, each component is indexed and\\nqueries on the component field can be optimized by this\\nindex. There is no special syntax required for creating\\narray indexes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if the field contains an array, it will be\\nindexed as a array index.\\n\\nIndexing\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 TTL Indexes. In some cases data should expire out of\\nthe system automatically. Time to Live (TTL) indexes\\nallow the user to specify a period of time after which the\\ndata will automatically be deleted from the database. A\\ncommon use of TTL indexes is applications that\\nmaintain a rolling window of history (e.g., most recent\\n100 days) for user actions such as clickstreams.\\n\\nIndexes are a crucial mechanism for optimizing system\\nperformance and scalability while providing flexible access\\nto the data. Like most database management systems,\\nwhile indexes will improve the performance of some\\noperations by orders of magnitude, they incur associated\\noverhead in write operations, disk usage, and memory\\nconsumption. By default, the WiredTiger storage engine\\ncompresses indexes in RAM, freeing up more of the\\nworking set for documents.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Geospatial Indexes. MongoDB provides geospatial\\nindexes to optimize queries related to location within a\\ntwo dimensional space, such as projection systems for\\nthe earth. These indexes allow MongoDB to optimize\\nqueries for documents that contain points or a polygon\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cthat are closest to a given point or line; that are within a\\ncircle, rectangle, or polygon; or that intersect with a\\ncircle, rectangle, or polygon.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Partial Indexes. By specifying a filtering expression\\nduring index creation, a user can instruct MongoDB to\\ninclude only documents that meet the desired\\nconditions, for example by only indexing active\\ncustomers. Partial indexes balance delivering low\\nlatency query performance while reducing system\\noverhead.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Sparse Indexes. Sparse indexes only contain entries\\nfor documents that contain the specified field. Because\\nthe document data model of MongoDB allows for\\nflexibility in the data model from document to document,\\nit is common for some fields to be present only in a\\nsubset of all documents. Sparse indexes allow for\\nsmaller, more efficient indexes when fields are not\\npresent in all documents.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Text Sear\\nSearcch Indexes. MongoDB provides a specialized\\nindex for text search that uses advanced,\\nlanguage-specific linguistic rules for stemming,\\ntokenization, case sensitivity and stop words. Queries\\nthat use the text search index will return documents in\\nrelevance order. One or more fields can be included in\\nthe text index.\\n\\nQuery Optimization\\nMongoDB automatically optimizes queries to make\\nevaluation as efficient as possible. Evaluation normally\\nincludes selecting data based on predicates, and sorting\\ndata based on the sort criteria provided. The query\\noptimizer selects the best index to use by periodically\\nrunning alternate query plans and selecting the index with\\nthe best response time for each query type. The results of\\nthis empirical test are stored as a cached query plan and\\nare updated periodically. Developers can review and\\noptimize plans using the powerful explain method and\\nindex filters. Using MongoDB Compass, DBAs can\\nvisualize index coverage, enabling them to determine which\\nspecific fields are indexed, their type, size, and how often\\nthey are used. Compass also provides the ability to\\nvisualize explain plans, presenting key information on how\\na query performed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for example the number of documents\\nreturned, execution time, index usage, and more. Each\\n\\nstage of the execution pipeline is represented as a node in\\na tree, making it simple to view explain plans from queries\\ndistributed across multiple nodes.\\nIndex intersection provides additional flexibility by enabling\\nMongoDB to use more than one index to optimize an\\nad-hoc query at run-time.\\n\\nCovered Queries\\nQueries that return results containing only indexed fields\\nare called covered queries. These results can be returned\\nwithout reading from the source documents. With the\\nappropriate indexes, workloads can be optimized to use\\npredominantly covered queries.\\n\\nMongoDB Data Management\\nAuto-Sharding\\nMongoDB provides horizontal scale-out for databases on\\nlow cost, commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure using\\na technique called sharding, which is transparent to\\napplications. Sharding distributes data across multiple\\nphysical partitions called shards. Sharding allows\\nMongoDB deployments to address the hardware\\nlimitations of a single server, such as bottlenecks in RAM\\nor disk I/O, without adding complexity to the application.\\nMongoDB automatically balances the data in the sharded\\ncluster as the data grows or the size of the cluster\\nincreases or decreases.\\nUnlike relational databases, sharding is automatic and built\\ninto the database. Developers don\\'t face the complexity of\\nbuilding sharding logic into their application code, which\\nthen needs to be updated as shards are migrated.\\nOperations teams don\\'t need to deploy additional\\nclustering software or expensive shared-disk infrastructure\\nto manage process and data distribution or failure recovery.\\n\\nFigur\\nFigure\\ne 6: Automatic sharding provides horizontal scalability\\nin MongoDB.\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cUnlike other distributed databases, multiple sharding\\npolicies are available that enable developers and\\nadministrators to distribute data across a cluster according\\nto query patterns or data locality. As a result, MongoDB\\ndelivers much higher scalability across a diverse set of\\nworkloads:\\n\\nquery to all shards, aggregating and sorting the results as\\nappropriate. Multiple query routers can be used with a\\nMongoDB system, and the appropriate number is\\ndetermined based on performance and availability\\nrequirements of the application.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Range Shar\\nSharding.\\nding. Documents are partitioned across\\nshards according to the shard key value. Documents\\nwith shard key values close to one another are likely to\\nbe co-located on the same shard. This approach is well\\nsuited for applications that need to optimize range\\nbased queries.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Hash Shar\\nSharding.\\nding. Documents are distributed according\\nto an MD5 hash of the shard key value. This approach\\nguarantees a uniform distribution of writes across\\nshards, but is less optimal for range-based queries.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Zone Shar\\nSharding.\\nding. Provides the the ability for DBAs and\\noperations teams to define specific rules governing data\\nplacement in a sharded cluster. Zones accommodate a\\nrange of deployment scenarios \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for example locating\\ndata by geographic region, by hardware configuration\\nfor tiered storage architectures, or by application\\nfeature. Administrators can continuously refine data\\nplacement rules by modifying shard key ranges, and\\nMongoDB will automatically migrate the data to its new\\nzone.\\nTens of thousands of organizations use MongoDB to build\\nhigh-performance systems at scale. You can read more\\nabout them on the MongoDB scaling page.\\n\\nQuery Router\\nSharding is transparent to applications; whether there is\\none or one hundred shards, the application code for\\nquerying MongoDB is the same. Applications issue queries\\nto a query router that dispatches the query to the\\nappropriate shards.\\nFor key-value queries that are based on the shard key, the\\nquery router will dispatch the query to the shard that\\nmanages the document with the requested key. When\\nusing range-based sharding, queries that specify ranges on\\nthe shard key are only dispatched to shards that contain\\ndocuments with values within the range. For queries that\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use the shard key, the query router will broadcast the\\n\\nFigur\\nFigure\\ne 7: Sharding is transparent to applications.\\n\\nConsistency\\nTransaction Model & Configurable Write\\nAvailability\\nMongoDB is ACID compliant at the document level. One or\\nmore fields may be written in a single operation, including\\nupdates to multiple sub-documents and elements of an\\narray. The ACID guarantees provided by MongoDB ensures\\ncomplete isolation as a document is updated; any errors\\ncause the operation to roll back and clients receive a\\nconsistent view of the document.\\nMongoDB also allows users to specify write availability in\\nthe system using an option called the write concern. The\\ndefault write concern acknowledges writes from the\\napplication, allowing the client to catch network exceptions\\nand duplicate key errors. Developers can use MongoDB\\'s\\nWrite Concerns to configure operations to commit to the\\napplication only after specific policies have been fulfilled \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nfor example only after the operation has been flushed to\\nthe journal on disk. This is the same mode used by many\\ntraditional relational databases to provide durability\\nguarantees. As a distributed system, MongoDB presents\\nadditional flexibility in enabling users to achieve their\\ndesired durability goals, such as writing to at least two\\nreplicas in one data center and one replica in a second\\ndata center. Each query can specify the appropriate write\\nconcern, ranging from unacknowledged to\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cacknowledgement that writes have been committed to all\\nreplicas.\\n\\nAvailability\\nReplication\\nMongoDB maintains multiple copies of data called replica\\nsets using native replication. A replica set is a fully\\nself-healing shard that helps prevent database downtime\\nand can be used to scale read operations. Replica failover\\nis fully automated, eliminating the need for administrators\\nto intervene manually.\\nA replica set consists of multiple replicas. At any given time\\none member acts as the primary replica set member and\\nthe other members act as secondary replica set members.\\nMongoDB is strongly consistent by default: reads and\\nwrites are issued to a primary copy of the data. If the\\nprimary member fails for any reason (e.g., hardware failure,\\nnetwork partition) one of the secondary members is\\nautomatically elected to primary, typically within several\\nseconds. As discussed below, sophisticated rules govern\\nwhich secondary replicas are evaluated for promotion to\\nthe primary member.\\n\\nFigur\\nFigure\\ne 8: Self-Healing MongoDB Replica Sets for High\\nAvailability\\nThe number of replicas in a MongoDB replica set is\\nconfigurable: a larger number of replicas provides\\nincreased data durability and protection against database\\ndowntime (e.g., in case of multiple machine failures, rack\\nfailures, data center failures, or network partitions). Up to\\n50 members can be provisioned per replica set.\\nEnabling tunable consistency, applications can optionally\\nread from secondary replicas, where data is eventually\\nconsistent by default. Reads from secondaries can be\\nuseful in scenarios where it is acceptable for data to be\\nslightly out of date, such as some reporting and analytical\\napplications. Administrators can control which secondary\\nmembers service a query, based on a consistency window\\ndefined in the driver. For data-center aware reads,\\napplications can also read from the closest copy of the\\ndata as measured by ping distance to reduce the effects of\\ngeographic latency . For more on reading from secondaries\\nsee the entry on Read Preference.\\nReplica sets also provide operational flexibility by providing\\na way to upgrade hardware and software without requiring\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cthe database to be taken offline. This is an important\\nfeature as these types of operations can account for as\\nmuch as one third of all downtime in traditional systems.\\n\\nReplica Set Oplog\\nOperations that modify a database on the primary replica\\nset member are replicated to the secondary members\\nusing the oplog (operations log). The oplog contains an\\nordered set of idempotent operations that are replayed on\\nthe secondaries. The size of the oplog is configurable and\\nby default is 5% of the available free disk space. For most\\napplications, this size represents many hours of operations\\nand defines the recovery window for a secondary, should\\nthis replica go offline for some period of time and need to\\ncatch up to the primary when it recovers.\\nIf a secondary replica set member is down for a period\\nlonger than is maintained by the oplog, it must be\\nrecovered from the primary replica using a process called\\ninitial synchronization. During this process all databases\\nwith their collections and indexes are copied from the\\nprimary or another replica to the secondary. Initial\\nsynchronization is also performed when adding a new\\nmember to a replica set, or migrating between MongoDB\\nstorage engines. For more information see the page on\\nReplica Set Data Synchronization.\\n\\nElections And Failover\\nReplica sets reduce operational overhead and improve\\nsystem availability. If the primary replica for a shard fails,\\nsecondary replicas together determine which replica\\nshould be elected as the new primary using an extended\\nimplementation of the Raft consensus algorithm. Once the\\nelection process has determined the new primary, the\\nsecondary members automatically start replicating from it.\\nIf the original primary comes back online, it will recognize\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s change in state and automatically assume the role of a\\nsecondary.\\n\\nElection Priority\\nSophisticated algorithms control the replica set election\\nprocess, ensuring only the most suitable secondary\\nmember is promoted to primary, and reducing the risk of\\n\\nunnecessary failovers (also known as \"false positives\"). In a\\ntypical deployment, a new primary replica set member is\\npromoted within several seconds of the original primary\\nfailing. During this time, queries configured with the\\nappropriate read preference can continue to be serviced by\\nsecondary replica set members. The election algorithms\\nevaluate a range of parameters including analysis of\\nelection identifiers and timestamps to identify those replica\\nset members that have applied the most recent updates\\nfrom the primary; heartbeat and connectivity status; and\\nuser-defined priorities assigned to replica set members. In\\nan election, the replica set elects an eligible member with\\nthe highest priority value as primary. By default, all\\nmembers have a priority of 1 and have an equal chance of\\nbecoming primary; however, it is possible to set priority\\nvalues that affect the likelihood of a replica becoming\\nprimary.\\nIn some deployments, there may be operational\\nrequirements that can be addressed with election priorities.\\nFor instance, all replicas located in a secondary data center\\ncould be configured with a priority so that one of them\\nwould only become primary if the main data center fails.\\n\\nPerformance & Compression\\nIn-Memory Performance With On-Disk\\nCapacity\\nWith the In-Memory storage engine, MongoDB users can\\nrealize the performance advantages of in-memory\\ncomputing for operational and real-time analytics\\nworkloads. The In-Memory storage engine delivers the\\nextreme throughput and predictable latency demanded by\\nthe most performance-intensive applications in AdTech,\\nfinance, telecoms, IoT, eCommerce and more, eliminating\\nthe need for separate caching layers.\\nMongoDB replica sets allow for hybrid in-memory and\\non-disk database deployments. Data managed by the\\nIn-Memory engine can be processed and analyzed in real\\ntime, before being automatically replicated to MongoDB\\ninstances configured with the persistent disk-based\\nWiredTiger storage engine. Lengthy ETL cycles typical\\nwhen moving data between different databases is avoided,\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cand users no longer have to trade away the scalable\\ncapacity or durability guarantees offered by disk storage.\\n\\nStorage & Network Efficiency with\\nCompression\\nThe WiredTiger and Encrypted storage engines support\\nnative compression, reducing physical storage footprint by\\nas much as 80%. In addition to reduced storage space,\\ncompression enables much higher storage I/O scalability\\nas fewer bits are read from disk.\\nAdministrators have the flexibility to configure specific\\ncompression algorithms for collections, indexes and the\\njournal, choosing between:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Snappy (the default library for documents and the\\njournal), provides the optimum balance between high\\ndocument compression ratio \\xe2\\x80\\x93 typically around 70%,\\ndependent on data types \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with low CPU overhead.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 zlib, providing higher document compression ratios for\\nstorage-intensive applications at the expense of extra\\nCPU overhead.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Prefix compression for indexes reducing the in-memory\\nfootprint of index storage by around 50%, freeing up\\nmore of the working set in RAM for frequently accessed\\ndocuments. As with snappy, the actual compression\\nratio will be dependent on workload.\\nAdministrators can modify the default compression\\nsettings for all collections and indexes. Compression is also\\nconfigurable on a per-collection and per-index basis during\\ncollection and index creation.\\nAs a distributed database, MongoDB relies on efficient\\nnetwork transport during query routing and inter-node\\nreplication. In addition to storage, MongoDB also offers\\nintra-cluster network compression. Based on the snappy\\ncompression algorithm, network traffic can be compressed\\nby up to 70%, providing major performance benefits in\\nbandwidth-constrained environments, and reducing\\nnetworking costs.\\n\\nSecurity\\nThe frequency and severity of data breaches continues to\\nescalate. Industry analysts predict cybercrime will cost the\\nglobal economy $6 trillion annually by 2021. Organizations\\nface an onslaught of new threat classes and threat actors\\nwith phishing, ransomware and intellectual property theft\\ngrowing more than 50% year on year, and key\\ninfrastructure subject to increased disruption. With\\ndatabases storing an organization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most important\\ninformation assets, securing them is top of mind for\\nadministrators.\\nMongoDB Enterprise Advanced features extensive\\ncapabilities to defend, detect, and control access to data:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Authentic\\nAuthentication.\\nation. Simplifying access control to the\\ndatabase, MongoDB offers integration with external\\nsecurity mechanisms including LDAP, Windows Active\\nDirectory, Kerberos, and x.509 certificates.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Authorization. User-defined roles enable\\nadministrators to configure granular permissions for a\\nuser or an application based on the privileges they need\\nto do their job. These can be defined in MongoDB, or\\ncentrally within an LDAP server. Additionally,\\nadministrators can define views that expose only a\\nsubset of data from an underlying collection, i.e. a view\\nthat filters or masks specific fields, such as Personally\\nIdentifiable Information (PII) from customer data or\\nhealth records.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Auditing. For regulatory compliance, security\\nadministrators can use MongoDB\\'s native audit log to\\ntrack any operation taken against the database \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nwhether DML, DCL or DDL.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Encryption. MongoDB data can be encrypted on the\\nnetwork, on disk and in backups. With the Encrypted\\nstorage engine, protection of data at-rest is an integral\\nfeature within the database. By natively encrypting\\ndatabase files on disk, administrators eliminate both the\\nmanagement and performance overhead of external\\nencryption mechanisms. Only those staff who have the\\nappropriate database authorization credentials can\\naccess the encrypted data, providing additional levels of\\ndefence.\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cTo learn more, download the MongoDB Security Reference\\nArchitecture Whitepaper.\\n\\nadministrators have traditionally performed manually \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\ndeploying a new cluster, upgrades, creating point in time\\nbackups, and many other operational activities.\\n\\nManaging MongoDB Provisioning, Monitoring and\\nDisaster Recovery\\n\\nOps Manager is designed to adapt to problems as they\\narise by continuously assessing state and making\\nadjustments as needed. Using a sophisticated rules engine,\\nagents adjust their individual plans as conditions change. In\\nthe face of many failure scenarios \\xe2\\x80\\x93 such as server failures\\nand network partitions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 agents will revise their plans to\\nreach a safe state.\\n\\nCreated by the engineers who develop the database,\\nMongoDB Ops Manager is the simplest way to run\\nMongoDB in your own environment, making it easy for\\noperations teams to deploy, monitor, backup and scale\\nMongoDB. The capabilities of Ops Manager are also\\navailable in the MongoDB Cloud Manager tool hosted in\\nthe cloud. Organizations who run with MongoDB Enterprise\\nAdvanced can choose between Ops Manager and Cloud\\nManager for their deployments.\\nOps Manager incorporates best practices to help keep\\nmanaged databases healthy and optimized. They ensures\\noperational continuity by converting complex manual tasks\\ninto reliable, automated procedures with the click of a\\nbutton.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Deployment.

Monitor 100+ system metrics\\nand get custom alerts before the system degrades.\\n\\nDeployments and Upgrades\\nOps Manager coordinates critical operational tasks across\\nthe servers in a MongoDB system. It communicates with\\nthe infrastructure through agents installed on each server.\\nThe servers can reside in the public cloud or a private data\\ncenter. Ops Manager reliably orchestrates the tasks that\\n\\nIn addition to initial deployment, Ops Manager makes it\\npossible to dynamically resize capacity by adding shards\\nand replica set members. Other maintenance tasks such as\\nupgrading MongoDB, building new indexes across replica\\nsets or resizing the oplog can be reduced from dozens or\\nhundreds of manual steps to the click of a button, all with\\nzero downtime.\\nAdministrators can use the Ops Manager interface directly,\\nor invoke the Ops Manager RESTful API from existing\\nenterprise tools.\\n\\nMonitoring\\nHigh-performance distributed systems benefit from\\ncomprehensive monitoring. Ops Manager and Cloud\\nManager have been developed to give administrators the\\ninsights needed to ensure smooth operations and a great\\nexperience for end users.\\nFeaturing charts, custom dashboards, and automated\\nalerting, Ops Manager tracks 100+ key database and\\nsystems health metrics including operations counters,\\nmemory and CPU utilization, replication status, open\\nconnections, queues and any node status.\\nThe metrics are securely reported to Ops Manager where\\nthey are processed, aggregated, alerted and visualized in a\\nbrowser, letting administrators easily determine the health\\nof MongoDB in real-time. Historic performance can be\\nreviewed in order to create operational baselines and to\\nsupport capacity planning. The Visual Query Profiler\\nprovides a quick and convenient way for DBAs to analyze\\nthe performance of specific queries or query families. It can\\nalso provide recommendations on the addition of indexes\\nthat would improve performance of common operations.\\n13\\n\\n\\x0cFigur\\nFigure\\ne 9: Ops Manager self-service portal: simple, intuitive and powerful. Deploy and upgrade entire clusters with a single\\nclick.\\nIntegration with existing monitoring tools is also\\nstraightforward via the Ops Manager and Cloud Manager\\nRESTful API, and with packaged integrations to leading\\nApplication Performance Management (APM) platforms\\nsuch as New Relic. This integration allows MongoDB\\nstatus to be consolidated and monitored alongside the rest\\n\\nof your application infrastructure, all from a single pane of\\nglass.\\nOps Manager allows administrators to set custom alerts\\nwhen key metrics are out of range. Alerts can be\\nconfigured for a range of parameters affecting individual\\nhosts, replica sets, agents and backup. Alerts can be sent\\nvia SMS and email or integrated into existing incident\\nmanagement systems such as PagerDuty, Slack, HipChat\\nand others to proactively warn of potential issues, before\\nthey escalate to costly outages.\\nIf using Cloud Manager, access to real-time monitoring\\ndata can also be shared with MongoDB support engineers,\\nproviding fast issue resolution by eliminating the need to\\nship logs between different teams.\\n\\nFigur\\nFigure\\ne1\\n10:\\n0: Ops Manager provides real time & historic\\nvisibility into the MongoDB deployment.\\n\\nDisaster Recovery: Backups &\\nPoint-in-Time Recovery\\nA backup and recovery strategy is necessary to protect\\nyour mission-critical data against catastrophic failure, such\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cas a fire or flood in a data center, or human error, such as\\ncode errors or accidentally dropping collections. With a\\nbackup and recovery strategy in place, administrators can\\nrestore business operations without data loss, and the\\norganization can meet regulatory and compliance\\nrequirements. Taking regular backups offers other\\nadvantages, as well. The backups can be used to create\\nnew environments for development, staging, or QA without\\nimpacting production.\\nOps Manager and Cloud Manager backups are maintained\\ncontinuously, just a few seconds behind the operational\\nsystem. Because Ops Manager only reads the oplog, the\\nongoing performance impact is minimal \\xe2\\x80\\x93 similar to that of\\nadding an additional replica to a replica set. If the\\nMongoDB cluster experiences a failure, the most recent\\nbackup is only moments behind, minimizing exposure to\\ndata loss. Ops Manager and Cloud Manager offer\\npoint-in-time backup of replica sets and cluster-wide\\nsnapshots of sharded clusters. You can restore to precisely\\nthe moment you need, quickly and safely.\\nAutomation-driven restores allows fully a configured\\ncluster to be re-deployed directly from the database\\nsnapshots in a just few clicks.\\nBy using MongoDB Enterprise Advanced you can deploy\\nOps Manager to control backups in your local data center,\\nor use the Cloud Manager service which offers a fully\\nmanaged backup solution with a pay-as-you-go model.\\nDedicated MongoDB engineers monitor user backups on a\\n24x365 basis, alerting operations teams if problems arise.\\n\\nSNMP: Integrating MongoDB with\\nExternal Monitoring Solutions\\nIn addition to Ops Manager and Cloud Manager, MongoDB\\nEnterprise Advanced can report system information to\\nSNMP traps, supporting centralized data collection and\\naggregation via external monitoring solutions. Review the\\ndocumentation to learn more about SNMP integration.\\n\\nMongoDB Atlas: Database as a\\nService For MongoDB\\nMongoDB Atlas provides all of the features of MongoDB,\\nwithout the operational heavy lifting required for any new\\napplication. MongoDB Atlas is available on-demand\\nthrough a pay-as-you-go model and billed on an hourly\\nbasis, letting you focus on what you do best.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to get started \\xe2\\x80\\x93 use a simple GUI to select the\\ninstance size, region, and features you need.
